# ML_Fairness
I participated in the Engima hackathon, where I had to get the optimized harmonic score of the F1 score and the Demogrphic pairity of the gender column of the given dataset. I used fairlearn threshold optimizer along with a voting classifier. My team achieved 2nd position in this hackathon.
